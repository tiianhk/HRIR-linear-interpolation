# Linear interpolation of HRIRs
This project tested four linear interpolations on the CIPIC dataset.  
HRIRs of a target point can be interpolated by the adjacent azimuth or elevation pair, in the form of rectangular or polar for complex DFT coefficients.  
See code in the [Colab Notebook](https://colab.research.google.com/github/tiianhk/hrir-linear-interpolation/blob/main/Linear_Interpolation_CIPIC_HRIRs.ipynb).
